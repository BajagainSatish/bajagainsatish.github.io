  <h1>Your Name</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my portfolio. Here are my core projects:</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h2>Full‑Stack E‑commerce Website (ASP .NET & TypeScript)</h2>
    <p>Built an admin dashboard with RESTful APIs for product, brand and category CRUD plus a cart system that tracks quantities. Implemented client‑side form validation and localStorage for state management, backed by ASP .NET Core and Entity Framework (MSSQL).</p>
  </div>

  <div class = "project">
    <h2>Unity Card Game</h2>
    <p>Created a turn‑based card game in C# featuring drag‑and‑drop mechanics, custom decks and score tracking. Managed game state and UI elements (hand, draw/discard piles) within Unity.    </p>
  </div>

  <div class = "project">
    <h2>Unity Music/MIDI‑Driven Game
    </h2>
    <p>Developed an interactive game that responds to live MIDI input, mapping notes to in‑game events. Handled real‑time audio parsing and input mapping in Unity to trigger visual feedback.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class = "project">
    <h2>Unity Ship Movement Game
    </h2>
    <p>Designed a 3D ship controller using Unity’s Rigidbody physics for smooth navigation and collision detection. Added UI overlays for health and ammo indicators.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class = "project">
    <h2>Unity 3D Guitar Simulator
    </h2>
    <p>Implemented a virtual 3D guitar featuring pluckable strings, animation and audio synthesis. Mapped user input to string actions and visual effects in Unity.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class = "project">
    <h2>Unity 3D Keyboard Simulator
    </h2>
    <p>Built a responsive 3D keyboard that plays notes and animates keys on input. Integrated dynamic note visualization and sound playback.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class = "project">
    <h2>ML Project: Nepali Letter Detection (YOLO‑based)
    </h2>
    <p>Applied a YOLO object‑detection model to identify handwritten Nepali characters with over 90% mAP.
